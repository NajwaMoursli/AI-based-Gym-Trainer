# AI-based-Gym-Trainer
The goal is to develop a human pose detection system based on AI \& motion detection. 
We seek to aid people in performing the correct posture for exercises, so they don’t damage themselves at the gym, by building a software application that detects and scores the exercise pose made by the user and finally send a feedback. This application will use the latest advances in pose estimation and machine learning (neural network).
This project is requested by ISIR (Institut des systèmes intelligents et robotiques).
